# CFB_Jogo-do-Galo

HASH

This page was made through the CANAL FESSOR BRUNO - CFB CURSOS, in which Professor Bruno teaches how to create some popular games using several programming languages.

This project consists of the creation of a tic-tac-toe game programmed in JavaScript.

I took this course when I was starting to study web development and it helped me a lot to fix some concepts of programming logic and JavaScript.
